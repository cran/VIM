\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} with two columns.}

\item{delimiter}{a character-vector to distinguish between variables and
imputation-indices for imputed variables (therefore, \code{x} needs to have
\code{\link{colnames}}). If given, it is used to determine the corresponding
imputation-index for any imputed variable (a logical-vector indicating which
values of the variable have been imputed). If such imputation-indices are
found, they are used for highlighting and the colors are adjusted according
to the given colors for imputed variables (see \code{col}).}

\item{col}{a vector of length five giving the colors to be used in the plot.
The first color is used for the scatterplot and the boxplots for the
available data. In case of missing values, the second color is taken for the
univariate scatterplots and boxplots for missing values in one variable and
the third for the frequency of missing/imputed values in both variables (see
\sQuote{Details}). Otherwise, in case of imputed values, the fourth color is
used for the highlighting, the frequency, the univariate scatterplot and the
boxplots of mputed values in the first variable and the fifth color for the
same applied to the second variable. A black color is used for the
highlighting and the frequency of imputed values in both variables instead.
If only one color is supplied, it is used for the bivariate and univariate
scatterplots and the boxplots for missing/imputed values in one variable,
whereas the boxplots for the available data are transparent.  Else if two
colors are supplied, the second one is recycled.}

\item{alpha}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the level of
transparency of the colors, or \code{NULL}.  This can be used to prevent
overplotting.}

\item{pch}{a vector of length two giving the plot symbols to be used for the
scatterplot and the univariate scatterplots.  If a single plot character is
supplied, it is used for the scatterplot and the default value will be used
for the univariate scatterplots (see \sQuote{Details}).}

\item{cex}{the character expansion factor to be used for the bivariate and
univariate scatterplots.}

\item{numbers}{a logical indicating whether the frequencies of
missing/imputed values should be displayed in the lower left of the plot
(see \sQuote{Details}).}

\item{cex.numbers}{the character expansion factor to be used for the
frequencies of the missing/imputed values.}

\item{zeros}{a logical vector of length two indicating whether the variables
are semi-continuous, i.e., contain a considerable amount of zeros.  If
\code{TRUE}, only the non-zero observations are used for drawing the
respective boxplot.  If a single logical is supplied, it is recycled.}

\item{xlim, ylim}{axis limits.}

\item{main, sub}{main and sub title.}

\item{xlab, ylab}{axis labels.}

\item{ann}{a logical indicating whether plot annotation (\code{main},
\code{sub}, \code{xlab}, \code{ylab}) should be displayed.}

\item{axes}{a logical indicating whether both axes should be drawn on the
plot.  Use graphical parameter \code{"xaxt"} or \code{"yaxt"} to suppress
only one of the axes.}

\item{frame.plot}{a logical indicating whether a box should be drawn around
the plot.}

\item{\dots}{further graphical parameters to be passed down (see
\code{\link[graphics]{par}}).}
}
\description{
In addition to a standard scatterplot, information about missing/imputed
values is shown in the plot margins. Furthermore, imputed values are
highlighted in the scatterplot.
}
\details{
Boxplots for available and missing/imputed data, as well as univariate
scatterplots for missing/imputed values in one variable are shown in the
plot margins.

Imputed values in either of the variables are highlighted in the
scatterplot.

Furthermore, the frequencies of the missing/imputed values can be displayed
by a number (lower left of the plot). The number in the lower left corner is
the number of observations that are missing/imputed in both variables.
}
\note{
Some of the argument names and positions have changed with versions
1.3 and 1.4 due to extended functionality and for more consistency with
other plot functions in \code{VIM}.  For back compatibility, the argument
\code{cex.text} can still be supplied to \code{\dots{}} and is handled
correctly.  Nevertheless, it is deprecated and no longer documented.  Use
\code{cex.numbers} instead.

\examples{


data(tao, package = "VIM")
data(chorizonDL, package = "VIM")
## for missing values
marginplot(tao[,c("Air.Temp", "Humidity")])
marginplot(log10(chorizonDL[,c("CaO", "Bi")]))

## for imputed values
marginplot(kNN(tao[,c("Air.Temp", "Humidity")]), delimiter = "_imp")
marginplot(kNN(log10(chorizonDL[,c("CaO", "Bi")])), delimiter = "_imp")
